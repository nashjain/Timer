===

Simple (offline) JavaScript based count down timer with sound indicator when the time is up.

Usage
==
/Timer - Defaults the time to 5 mins
/Timer/?d=120 - Time is set to 120 secs (2 mins)

Background color changes to red when last 30 seconds are left. And then it starts beeping when the time is up. However the timer continues with a negative sign.
